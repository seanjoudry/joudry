        <p class="obituary">It is with profound sadness that the family of Bob (Robert) Raymond Joudry of Timberlea, Nova Scotia announces his passing on August 26th, 2023 at age 60 at the Halifax Infirmary after a medical emergency on August 8th.</p>

        <p class="obituary">Born in November 1962, in Saint John, New Brunswick to the late Marlene and Joseph Joudry, Bob grew up living across Canada and around the world as a child in a military family. He later joined the Canadian Armed Forces himself, where he served for over 42 years, primarily in air traffic control. Bob married his wife Carol, and later started a family of three children: Sean, Catherine, and Evan. While being in a military family was at times difficult due to time spent apart, they were always grateful for the opportunities to see their beautiful country, and knew that Bob was dedicating his career to serving Canadians.</p>
        
        <p class="obituary">During his career, Bob was posted to Shearwater, NS; Ottawa, ON; Comox, BC; Goose Bay, NL; and Greenwood, NS. Additionally, he did four deployments with the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. In November of 2022, Bob retired with the rank of Warrant Officer.</p>
        
        <p class="obituary">Bob was a disciplined military man who rarely complained. He worked tirelessly and acted as a steadfast moral compass for his family and those around him. He had a skill for cooking elaborate meals for his family in between watching reruns of old science fiction shows and browsing local shops with Carol. Since retiring, Bob could rarely be found at home, taking trips all around Toronto and the Maritimes.</p>
        
        <p class="obituary">Not one to be sitting idle, Bob had just completed training, and was prepared to go back to work in August with the Commissionaires.</p>
        
        <p class="obituary">Bob is predeceased by his parents Marlene (Rogers) and Joseph Joudry; sister, Pam (Darrell) Urquhart; and many aunts and uncles. Bob is survived by his loving wife, Carol; his children Sean (Julia), Catherine, and Evan; sister, Debbie (Charlie) Kennedy; sister-in-law Linda (Howard) Allen; in-laws Robert and Betty Carson; as well as many extended family members.</p>
        
        <p class="obituary">In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the QEII Health Sciences Foundation in Bobâ€™s memory. Arrangements have been entrusted to T.J. Tracey, Halifax. A celebration of life will be held on Saturday, September 16th at 1 PM.</p>
        
        <p class="obituary">Bob was deeply loved by all those around him and will be sorely missed.</p>
